A general approach to solving problems with code.

1. Identify your learning style(s) (teaching, spaced repetition, etc). I define learning as absorbing new information in a way that results in a destructive alteration to your mental model.

1. Learn more about the problem until the solution is obvious. In the process, what feels complicated will become straightforward, and what seems simple will become complex. The form of the problem is unimportant - it is simply an obstacle that must be overcome by way of thought.

1. Implement the solution. Implementation is the art of reducing complexity until the original problem vanishes - "I can't" gradually becomes "I can". The form of implementation depends on why you're solving the problem:

    - For your colleagues
    - For a deadline
    - To learn
    - To impress other programmers

1. In the process of implementation, you will inevitably learn more about the problem that will render your solution less obviously correct. When this happens, repeat step 2.
