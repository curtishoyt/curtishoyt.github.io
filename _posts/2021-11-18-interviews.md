Interviews should help you answer this question: Would I want to work with this person? I contend that live coding exercises do not meet this criterion.

On the interviewer's side, unless the ability to do live coding exercises is the most important trait they look for in a colleague, the interview serves no purpose.

On the candidate's side, unless the trait they value most in a colleague is the ability to judge live coding exercises, the interview is similarly pointless.

My proposed alternative: talk.
