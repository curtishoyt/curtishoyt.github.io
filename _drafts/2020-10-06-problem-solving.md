Learn more until the solution is obvious. In the process, what feels complicated becomes straightforward, and what seems simple becomes complex.

Learning is absorbing new information resulting in a destructive alteration to your mental model.

Implementing the solution is the art of reducing complexity until the original problem vanishes - usually "I can't" gradually becomes "I can".

The form of implementation depends on why you're programming in the first place:

- For your colleagues
- For a deadline
- To learn
- To impress other programmers

The form of the problem is unimportant - it is simply an obstacle that must be overcome by way of thought.
