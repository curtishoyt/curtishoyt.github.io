Reimagining CSS

I'm not a fan of CSS. I think there's too much redundancy and weird names. So here's my attempt to fix it.

| Old | New | Properties |
| ------------- | -- | -- |
| Display | Layout | Container, Grid
| Box Model | Frame | Inset, Border, Style
| Font | Font | Color, Name, Height, Weight
| Background | Wallpaper | Color, Style
| Transition | Shift | Delay, Duration
| @media | Device | Width
| Overflow | Excess | Content, Text
| Visibility | Opacity
