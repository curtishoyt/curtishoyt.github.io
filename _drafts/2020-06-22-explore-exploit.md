description: This is how you choose a Framework.
---
Now you have at least some idea of how to go about choosing which languages, frameworks, and libraries to use in your development process. Knowing your own motivations, which can then be translated into requirements, the criteria by which you will evaluate candidates have become clear. The search itself, however, is not.

Like everything else in the web app world, making any kind of decision is a horrific nightmare, no matter how small. It is a sea of frameworks, all different, all alike. Two days ago, it was finally proclaimed that React was our ultimate salvation... and then, yesterday, Svelte arrived.

Despite the fact that you now know, say, that you care more about the likelihood of any technology you use being around five years than you do about performance, there's no way around the fact that you are now faced with a very different problem than you were before - research.

But I can help. Not by giving you a leg-up on which framework is REALLY the best (because of GitHub Stars plus LinkedIn job posting mentions!), but by teaching you about time. Specifically, the explore-exploit tradeoff.

Since the goal here is to reach a state where you're comfortable deciding, here's what it looks like: You've set a timeline you are comfortable with (either a non-negotiable one you have accepted, a decision you've made based on a schedule, or a cutoff made on a good estimate of an inflection point). You've allocated your time intelligently between your focus areas based on good estimates of their importance. If you're working with a team, you've done this in a way that everyone feels as good about it as is feasible (either it was collaborative, or you described your process in as much detail as you could).
