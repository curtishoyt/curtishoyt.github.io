Does the peoples' intelligence matter?

Democracy works because accountability to voters forces the leaders to be in tune with the peoples' needs. Stupidity does not affect democracy more than it does any other form of government. The ones at the top ALWAYS get there through cunning, selfishness, and ruthlessness. Whether or not they're intelligent means nothing if they use their brains to benefit themselves at the expense of the people.
